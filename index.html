  <ol>A few basic facts:
    <li>I go to Coastal Carolina University (obviously).</li>
    <li>I am a Digital Culture and Design Major</li>
    <li>I am a confectioner at a candy store called Wee-R-Sweetz</li>
    <li>I love to cook almost as much as I love to eat!</li>
    <li>I enjoy going out for walks and playing video games in my free time</li>
  </ol>

  <!--This allows my image to show on the page. The class is so that I can reference it in my CSS-->
<p id="photography">I also enjoy taking pictures of scenes that I find particularly interesting. This is a picture of Edwards that I took on campus one night as I was out walking with my girlfriend. It is not uncommon for me to see something and immediately pull my phone out to take a picture. I don't fancy myself a photographer by any means, but I still find it incredibly fun to capture different scenes in different places. Other times, it's not uncommon for me to see something like a cool bug or a cute animal and rush to get a picture of it before I lose my chance at it. I nearly always have my phone out for one reason or another, so I make sure that I'm at the ready when an opportunity presents itself.</p>

<p id="photography2">Otherwise, I'm just your general college student trying to get by and do well. I love to tinker around with both hardware and software, but I am most certainly still a novice with both. I'm hoping throughout my DCD journey I'll learn plenty about both and hopefully become an expert in time.I guess I'm just going to have to see how it goes!</p>

  <h2 id="cook">Cooking</h2>
  <p id="cooking">I started off my college career in culinary school because I love to cook, but I realized that it wasn't for me. The environment was too stressful, and I decided that I like cooking what I want to cook, not something that someone else wants me to make. I still love to cook, and I particularly enjoy cooking for other people, but culinary school just was not my cup of tea. I found a happy medium at my current job, where I make saltwater taffy and some other confections for a candy store in North Myrtle Beach. I'm still working with food, but I get just enough creative freedom that I still enjoy what I do.</p>
  <h2 id="game">Video Games</h2>
  <p id="games">I was introduced to video games at a very young age, with my father letting me play on his Super Nintendo when I was around four years old. For a long time, I was quite heavily influenced by video games, with them taking up a huge part of my life and most of my free time. Around when high school hit, I stopped having time to play as much, between schoolwork, friends, girls, and, you know, sleeping and eating. I still love to play when I get the chance, but it's definitely not what it used to be to me.</p>
